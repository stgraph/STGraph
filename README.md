# üåü STGraph

STGraph is a framework designed for deep-learning practitioners to write and train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs). It is built on top of _Seastar_ and utilizes the vertex-centric approach to produce highly efficient fused GPU kernels for forward and backward passes. It achieves better usability, faster computation time and consumes less memory than state-of-the-art graph deep-learning systems like DGL, PyG and PyG-T.

## Why STGraph

The primary goal of _Seastar_ is more natural GNN programming so that the users learning curve is flattened. Our key observation lies in recognizing that the equation governing a GCN layer, as shown above, takes the form of vertex-centric computation and can be implemented succinctly with only one line of code. Moreover, we can see a clear correspondence between the GNN formulas and the vertex-centric implementations. The benefit is two-fold: users can effortlessly implement GNN models, while simultaneously understanding these models by inspecting their direct implementations.

The _Seastar_ system outperforms state-of-the-art GNN frameworks but lacks support for TGNNs. STGraph bridges that gap and enables users to to develop TGNN models through a vertex-centric approach. STGraph has shown to be significantly faster and more memory efficient that state-of-the-art frameworks like PyG-T for training TGNN models.

## Getting Started

Install, build and train your first TGNN model using STGraph by following the [installation guide](https://github.com/stgraph/STGraph/blob/main/INSTALLATION.md).
